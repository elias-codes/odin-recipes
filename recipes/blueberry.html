        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sweet blueberries and tart lemon pair well in this alternative to oatmeal. High in protein and fiber, quinoa is a great start to your day! I made this up one morning when I had a craving for quinoa and was looking for a change from the usual. Top with extra milk for a thinner consistency. Also good with a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup quinoa</li>
            <li>2 cups nonfat milk</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
            <li>Â½ lemon, zested</li>
            <li>1 cup blueberries</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons flax seed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Shred potateoes into a large bowl filled with cold water. Stir until water is cloudy, drain, and cover potatoes again with fresh cold water. Stir again to dissolve excess starch. Drain potatoes well, pat dry with patter towels, and squeeze out any excess moisture.</li>
            <li>Heat clarified butter in a large non-stick pan over medium heat. Sprinkle shredded potatoes into the hot butter and season with salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika.</li>
            <li>Cook potatoes until a brown crust forms on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until potatoes are browned all over, about 5 more minutes.</li>
        </ol>
